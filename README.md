#### MA6628-assignment1
##### this project is to find out the total number of twin primes between 1 thousand and 1 million
##### the biggest twin prime in the range described above is also an output of this project
##### a twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number, see for details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime

##### the structure of code is as following:
      1. define a function to figure out whether an integer is a prime number
      2. define a function to figure out whether two integers are twin prime with the defined function above
      3. find out the total number and the maxmimum twin primes between 1k and 1m

##### for detailed code and description, please refer to https://github.com/wallace2213/MA6628-assignment1/blob/master/find-twin-primes.py

##### result and output
##### number of twin primes= 8134
##### maxmimum twin primes= 999959.0, 999961.0
